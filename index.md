# Alexey Vishnyakov

Hi!

I am a M.D. student in the [Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics](https://cs.msu.ru/en) at [Lomonosov Moscow State University](https://www.msu.ru/en/).

I work for the Compiler Technology Department at [Ivannikov Institute for System Programming of the RAS](http://www.ispras.ru/en/) as a research scientist.

I have a strong interest in computer security, return-oriented programming, binary analysis, symbolic execution, reverse engineering, and compilers.
